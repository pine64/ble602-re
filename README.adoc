= Pine64's BL602 reverse engineering working group

== Notes

* The blobs were compiled using `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0 -march=rv32imfc
  -mabi=ilp32f -gdwarf -Os -std=gnu99 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
  -fstrict-volatile-bitfields -fshort-enums -ffreestanding
  -fno-strict-aliasing` which implies integers, longs, and pointers are all
  32-bits; and single-precision floats are supported by the hardware.

* Unless disabled entirely; the SiFive E24 only partially supports atomics.
  Load-reserved and store-conditionals are not implemented and will generate an
  illegal instruction exception if used.

== Toolset

* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain[RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain]

* https://cutter.re/[Cutter], a graphical frontend for
  https://www.radare.org/r/[radare2]

* https://github.com/sevaa/dwex[DWARF Explorer], an explorer for DWARF debugging data
 ** The proprietary libraries still contain DWARF data, but tool support for showing it varies greatly. This will show you the raw DWARF information (e.g. structures, function local variables, inlined function information).

* Add your favorite disassembly tools here. If the tool is not free, mark it
  with (non-free).

== Work log (top-down append-only)

=== WildCryptoFox (29 Oct 2020)

* Initialized README.adoc and copied LICENSE from the SDK.

* Split objects out of archives `ar x libx.a`.

* Disassembled objects to their assembly
  `pine64/bl_iot_sdk/toolchain/riscv/Linux/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d -r xx.o`
  
=== Yangff (30 Oct 2020)
  * Added three statically linked elf built from bl_iot_sdk to provide clear symbols for reverse engineering
  
  * The three examples are from commit 9a10205e96a6b10e22069c87625550cad666b1b4, bl602_demo_at, bl602_demo_wifi and sdk_app_ble_sync.
  
  * They are compiled with the riscv toolchain shipped with the sdk and using `make -j` directly in the folders with `CONFIG_CHIP_NAME=BL602` and `CONFIG_LINK_ROM=1`. The disassembly is generated with `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d ./x.elf > ./x.S`

=== WildCryptoFox (3 Nov 2020)

* Added reko decompilation outputs for Yangff's 3 binaries above. Decompiled by
  Reko's developer @uxmal in
  https://github.com/uxmal/reko/issues/958[uxmal/reko#958], after patching
  32-bit RISC-V ELF handling and improving RISC-V decompilation output.
